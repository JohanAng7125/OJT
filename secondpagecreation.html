                <h2>How to get started</h2>
                <p>Unlike many outdoor sports,<img src="version_2/images/simple-steps.jpg" alt=""> getting started with bouldering is surprisingly simple. All you need are some climbing shoes, chalk, and a positive attitude—most gyms even rent the equipment for your first sessions. <strong> prior experience or complex gear required!</strong></p>
